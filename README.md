A dynamic notepad web application built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can:

1. Add and delete titles and subtasks
2. Mark subtasks as completed with strikethrough
3. Persist all data using localStorage, so tasks remain after page reload
4. Interact with a fully dynamic UI without any frameworks or libraries

This project demonstrates state-driven UI manipulation, event handling, and browser storage with pure JavaScript. It’s perfect for beginners and anyone looking to understand the fundamentals of building interactive web apps without external libraries.
